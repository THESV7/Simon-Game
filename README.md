# Simon Game

Welcome to the Simon Game! This is a classic memory game that tests your ability to remember and repeat sequences of colors and sounds. The game has a simple concept but can become challenging as the sequences get longer.

## Rules

- Simon, the game's AI, will play a sequence of colors and sounds.
- Your task is to repeat the sequence in the same order.
- The sequence will increase by one step each time you repeat it correctly.
- If you make a mistake and repeat the sequence incorrectly, the game will end.
